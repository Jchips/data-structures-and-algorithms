# Array Binary Search

Write a function called BinarySearch which takes in 2 parameters: a sorted array and the search key. Without utilizing any of the built-in methods available to your language, return the index of the arrayâ€™s element that is equal to the value of the search key, or -1 if the element is not in the array.
NOTE: The search algorithm used in your function should be a binary search.

## Approach & Efficiency

I made a binary search algorithm with a while loop and variables to narrow down the index of search key in the given sorted array. I have not learned Big O yet.

## Solution

My code can be run by copying the code into a Javascript code editor with a console. It will also need an sorted array and a number value to take in as parameters and then a line of code consoling the result from the function.
