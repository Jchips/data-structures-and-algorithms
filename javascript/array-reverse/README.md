# Reverse an Array

Write a function called reverseArray which takes an array as an argument. Without utilizing any of the built-in methods available to your language, return an array with elements in reversed order.

## Approach & Efficiency

I used a for loop and a temp variable to solve the problem because it reversed the array in place instead of making a new array. That seemed most efficient. I have not learned Big O yet.

## Solution
<!-- Show how to run your code, and examples of it in action -->
My code can just be run by copying the code into a code editor with a console. It will also need an array to take in as a parameter and then a line of code consoling the result from the function.
